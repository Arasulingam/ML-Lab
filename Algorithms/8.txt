1. Import necessary libraries, including KMeans and GaussianMixture for clustering, and load the Iris dataset.

2. Create a DataFrame for features  X  and target labels  y , labeling the columns appropriately.

3. Visualize the actual data distribution using a scatter plot of petal length versus petal width.

4. Apply KMeans clustering to the dataset, fitting the model and visualizing the clusters in a scatter plot.

5. Standardize the data, apply Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) clustering, and visualize the resulting clusters in a third scatter plot.
