1. Import necessary libraries and load the dataset into a DataFrame, mapping labels ('pos' and 'neg') to numerical values.

2. Split the dataset into features \( X \) and target variable \( y \), and then use `train_test_split` to create training and testing sets.

3. Use `CountVectorizer` to convert the text data into a document-term matrix for both training and testing sets.

4. Train a `MultinomialNB` classifier on the training data and predict labels for the test set.

5. Evaluate the model using accuracy, recall, precision, and confusion matrix, printing the results for each metric.
