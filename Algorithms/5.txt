1. Import necessary libraries and read the dataset into a pandas DataFrame, displaying the first five rows.

2. Split the dataset into features \( X \) and target variable \( y \), then display the first five rows of each.

3. Use `LabelEncoder` to convert categorical variables in \( X \) (like Outlook, Temperature, Humidity, and Windy) into numerical format.

4. Split the data into training and testing sets using `train_test_split`.

5. Train a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier on the training data and evaluate its accuracy on the test set, displaying the accuracy score.
