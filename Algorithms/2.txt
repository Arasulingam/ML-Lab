1. Import necessary libraries and load the training data into a DataFrame.
2. Extract the concepts (features) and target labels (outcomes) from the DataFrame.
3. Initialize the specific hypothesis with the first positive example and create a general hypothesis with wildcards for all attributes.
4. For each example, update the specific hypothesis if it is positive, and update the general hypothesis if the example is negative.
5. Remove any general hypotheses that are completely wildcarded and return the final specific and general hypotheses.
