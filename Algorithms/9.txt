1. Import necessary libraries and load the Iris dataset.

2. Split the dataset into training and testing sets using `train_test_split`.

3. Initialize a K-Nearest Neighbors classifier with one neighbor and fit it to the training data.

4. Loop through the test set to make predictions for each instance and print the actual and predicted target values.

5. Output the accuracy score of the model on the test set.
