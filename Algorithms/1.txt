1. Start with the most general hypothesis, initializing all attributes to a placeholder.
2. Read the training data and filter out the positive examples with the desired outcome (e.g., "YES").
3. Set the first positive example as the initial hypothesis to begin refining.
4. For each positive example, compare it to the hypothesis and replace differing attributes with a wildcard (`?`).
5. After processing all examples, output the final, most specific hypothesis consistent with the positive examples.
